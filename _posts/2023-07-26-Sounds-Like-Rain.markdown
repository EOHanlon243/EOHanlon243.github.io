During my time at University, I took a year out to work with a startup company, **Kreek Interactive** to developed a project under the name:  **Sounds Like Rain**. This game was developed over the course of the year, leading to a completed demo project at the end of the project. This demo was showcased across events such as **Game Dev London Expo (GDLX)** and **W.A.S.D** to great reception.

Developed in **Unreal Engine 5** to allow for our artists to utilise their experimental shader that originally inspired the idea of this project. As this was a larger project, with our team mostly workign *remotely* with many opportunities of collaboration, we utilised **Jira** along side **Trello** to organised tasks and reponsibilities whilst establishing milestones over the year of development.

My responsibilites for this project revolved around player interaction and general control gameplay. The main feature being a robust weapons system to monitor and switch between different weapon. Other responsibilites includes system UI elements such as settings, featuring audio settings and dynamic keybind changing.
