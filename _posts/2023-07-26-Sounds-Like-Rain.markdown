Developed a playable demo in Unreal Engine 5 for an upcoming game ‘Sounds Like Rain’ showcased at game events including: Game Dev London Expo (GDLX) and WASD.

Was responsible for implementing player movement features such as sprinting and jumping. Developed a robust weapons system to monitor and utilise multiple weapon types.

Adapted well to a remote working environment. Had regular communication with my team and used problem-solving skills to effectively design and implement features for the demo.
