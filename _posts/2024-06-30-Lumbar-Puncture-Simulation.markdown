During my final year of university, a team of students including myself, had the opportuinty to work with **Fundalmental VR** to test out the accessiblity and usability of their **Software Development Kit (VR SDK)**. To do this, we were assigned with the task to create a detailed **Virtual Reality simulation** of a **Lumbar Puncture Procedure**, based upon a detailed brief by our client. Along with VR, we were granted the use of **Haptic Arm technologies** to provide more precision and feeling. For example: a needle penetrating different layers of skin.

To work with the SDK, we utilised **Unity** along with **Github** as our source control. As our time to work on VR was limit due to restrictions, the use **Jira** and **Trello** was vital in order to organise tasks, check progress and collaborate during key tasks. Alongside this, we utilised **Confluence** for detailed note taking and tracking of the progress and communicate methods developed over the project.

For this project, I was assigned to be the lead programmer along with futher responsibilites. This included updating programming related documentation, establishing and maintaining the source control to prevent conflicts. In addition, organising development sessions with assigned goals well as updating producers of our current progress, setbacks and projections for the future.
