**Titled Dog Game** is a game created for the **GJL Game Parade Fall 2021** game jam. Same as the GJL Game Parade in the summer, when we created ***Day of The Swimming Dead***, we were given two week to produce our game. The first for design and development and the second for polishing and fine tuning. The theme of the jam this time was *Leave Something Behind*.

As this took place not long after the previous team, our team decided to stick with **Unreal Engine 4** for development to futher learning and understanding. We used **Source Tree** along with **GitHub** to better visualise and manage game versions within our source control. **Trello** was used to collaborate effciently.

 My involvement with the game revolved around character movement and interactions, such as movement, pulling and pushing objects, puzzle mechanics and a bark feature. In addition, I was also responsible for creating the majority of UI elements to guide the player through the game and allow them to alter settings. I also worked alongside artists to righ models to player character to ensure actions and animations corresponded to each other.
