The Submariner Project was a joint collaboration project between the Royal Navy and the University of Portsmouth.The goal of the simulation is to traverse the sea in the submarine and identify a specific vessle. This would then later be showcased at Navy recruitment events to drive to increase interest.

Our clients wished for the project to be developed within Unity as teams who previously tackled this project also did the same. This project was my introduction to using source control,that being GitHub

As our team primarily consisted of programmers, my responsiblites were spread around different aspects of the project. This included looking into realistic world generation using Terragen 4, making colourblind agnostic game UI, and developing particle effects.
Towards the end of the project, as some of the main features were unfinished, team focus shifted towards these, leading me to fix and implement the boat AI and the main menu UI.
