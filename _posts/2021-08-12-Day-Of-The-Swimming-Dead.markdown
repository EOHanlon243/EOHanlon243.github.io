**Day of the Living Dead** is a game created for the **GJL Game Parade Summer 2021** game jam. We were given two weeks for the game, the first for designing and developing and the second was for polishing and fine tuning. The theme of the jam was *One Time Use*.

For this game, our team opted to use **Unreal Engine 4** for our game engine. This provided us with a learning experience as no one on the team had used this engine prior to this game jam. We used **GitHub** as our choice of source control and **Trello** to manage the workload between the team.

My responsiblities as a programmer involved developing various gameplay features surrounding the player character such as movement, aiming and creating the *One Time Use* weapons. Throughout the project I would also assist the programmers with developing the logic behind the gameplay loop and providing guidance with issues or problems when they arised. Finally, I worked alongside the artists to rig the models to work with certain features as well as integrating world related gameplay features to suit the environement.
